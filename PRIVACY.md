# Astrobot Privacy Policy

Astrobot is a chatbot operating on the Discord platform with which Discord users can freely interact.

Astrobot provides a charting system which gives Discord users the ability to lookup dates and locations, generate astrological charts/drawings and store data in Astrobot's database for later use.

Data stored by a Discord user is linked to the user's Discord ID and may include dates, which may or may not include someone's birth date or otherwise important date, and locations/addresses, which may or may not include someone's birth location or residency location, usually limited to city and country.

When stored in Astrobot's database, the above data will never be shared with any third parties and will never be used for anything other than providing Astrobot's charting services to Discord users. Furthermore, the above data cannot be directly accessed by other Discord users except in the form of an astrological chart/drawing.

Discord users who store data in Astrobot's database have full control over their data through Astrobot's chat commands and can freely modify and/or delete said data at any time as they wish. Additionally the user is able to configure their data as "private" which disables all access by other Discord users.

All user data stored in Astrobot's database will remain stored for as long as the linked user has an active Discord account and actively interacts with Astrobot. A user's data may be deleted if the user deletes their Discord account or becomes inactive for more than 1 year.

Users can also request linking their data to a different Discord account or request the total deletion of all their data at anytime, no questions asked, by contacting Astrobot's developer.

Any further questions or inquiries can be asked directly to Astrobot's developer.

Astrobot's developer can be reached through Discord under the following tag: `Tim#2373`.
